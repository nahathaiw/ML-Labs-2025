    "\n",
    "- In a competitive product market, pricing is often influenced by various factors, including technical specifications, functional attributes, brand value, and consumer demand. Understanding how these factors collectively determine product prices is a fundamental challenge in data-driven market analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For sales managers, setting an appropriate price for a newly launched product is crucial for maximizing profit. By analyzing how the prices of similar products are determined based on their specifications, one can develop more effective pricing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this Lab, students are required to develop a predictive model using a neural network architecture to estimate the price level of mobile phones based on their specifications.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Similar to the previous lab, We will be using .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) files and we recommend using **Anaconda**.\n",
    "- It's a chance for you the get familiar with Anaconda since our **coding exam** will be using the same.\n",
    "- If you are unsure about a function or its parameters, you can use help() to view its documentation. For example: help(train_test_split)\n",
    "- In this Lab, we will introduce a new tool named **PyTorch**, a Python library designed for developing your own machine learning models. **PyTorch** provides a comprehensive set of tools for developing neural networks, including utilities for constructing datasets, building models, specifying optimizers and loss functions, as well as training and evaluating models.\n",
    "    - For installing **PyTorch**, please follows the steps:\n",
    "        1. **PyTorch** is only support for CUDA-based(NVIDIA) GPU and CPU. You can use `nvidia-smi` in command line to check the CUDA version of your GPU.\n",
    "        2. Install **CUDA Toolkit** based on your CUDA version of your GPU. If you don't have GPU, skip this step.\n",
    "            - Here's the official CUDA installation guide: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/contents.html#\n",
    "            - Here's the official CUDA Toolkit archive: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive\n",
    "        3. Install **PyTorch** based on your CUDA version of your GPU. If you don't have GPU, install the CPU version **PyTorch**.\n",

    "- **Categorical Features** are variables that represent **categories** or **groups**. They discribe qualities or labels rather than numerical values. Categorical features can be either nominal (has no inherent order, e.g. gender, country, has married or not, etc.) or ordinal (has an natural order among values, e.g. education level, membership level, programming skill, etc.).\n",
    "- Since the values of categorical features are often non-numeric and carry different meanings, we need to **encode** them into a numerical form. A common approach is to encode them into **one-hot representation**, which converts the concept of category into set of binary values.\n",
    "- Try to use **`OneHotEncoder`** to encode each categorical feature into one-hot representation.\n",
    "    - Note: You should fit the encoder on the **training set only**, and then use the same encoder to **transform** the training set, validation set, and the testing set."

The step that are required during training but not during evaluation are (1) clear gradients(optimizer.zero_grad()) (4).backward propagation(loss.backward()) and (5). update model's parameters by optimizer(optimizer). And the reason is because these step are learning part of the process and the valid fuction purpose is only to measure the model performance not changing the model. loss.backward() and optimizer.step() are what allow the model to learn from its mistakes.\n",

    "2. Yes, I think my model is definitely experiencing overfitting. It is clear looking from my 100- epoch training log. \n",
    "Reason 1. Divering Loss--> my valid loss reach it lowest point at epoch 33 then my train loss kept getting lower but my valid loss stated to increase\n",
    "Reason 2. Diverging Accuracy--> my valid accurary peak at epoch 33 and after that my train accuracy krept going higher but my valid accuracy got worse. Which is a classic sign of overfitting. It show that the model stop learning and start memorizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To improve my model final performance, I tuned several key hyperparameters and architechtural design. The most important one was the LEARNING_RATE it was intially 0.1 which is too high so I change to 0.001. After that I also added one more hidden layer(to find more complex patterns). Then I increase the BATCH_SIZE from 4 to 32 and NUM_EPOCHS from 10 to 100.\n"
