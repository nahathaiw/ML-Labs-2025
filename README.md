This repository contains six machine learning labs completed for my ML course at National Tsing Hua University (NTHU).  
Each lab focuses on a core ML concept, from basic regression to advanced deep learning with diffusion models.

The goals of this repo are to:

- keep all course work in one clean place,
- show my progress in ML,
- and serve as part of my public portfolio.
